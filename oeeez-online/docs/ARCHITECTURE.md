# Oeeez.online Architecture

## Overview

Oeeez.online is a full-stack web application built with a microservices architecture. It consists of the following main components:

1. Frontend (Next.js)
2. Backend API (Express.js)
3. Database (MongoDB)
4. Blockchain Integration (Ethereum/Solidity)

## Frontend

The frontend is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and generates static websites for React-based web applications. It communicates with the backend API to fetch and update data.

Key technologies:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Backend API

The backend API is built with Express.js and provides RESTful endpoints for the frontend to interact with. It handles authentication, data processing, and communication with the database and blockchain.

Key technologies:
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

## Database

MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing user data, content, and other application-specific information.

## Blockchain Integration

The application integrates with the Ethereum blockchain for handling token transactions and smart contract interactions.

Key technologies:
- Solidity (for smart contracts)
- Web3.js (for blockchain interactions)
- Hardhat (for smart contract development and testing)

## Deployment

The application is deployed using a containerized approach with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalability and ease of management.
